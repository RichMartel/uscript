# uScript: Enhanced Edition

I am the author of the original uScript for the original Baldur's Gate II game.  20 years later I've decided to release my newer and rewritten "uScript" that I was using for the Beamdog Enhanced Editions of the games.  Unlike my original uScript, these scripts are based on Beamdog's default player script, and companion AI script.  They work a lot better than my originals and should seemlessly work without issue.

All spells, abilities, and items are supported that Beamdog placed in their scripts.  Since this is a "universal" script, the player and all companions have the same capabilities if they have the spell or ability in question.  This gives your party member more capabilities.  Personally, I really like the end result of this script.  It's consisistant with the design philosophy that Beamdog set forth.

A feature that I had in my original scripts from 20 years ago was automatic movement.  I personally like my party to stay with me when I'm fighting somewhere on the map.  This movement is MUCH improved from my original scripts and WILL NEVER override your commands.  If you want a hero to move to a certain location, they will move there, BUT if there is a fight and they are out of range they WILL move toward the fight unless you disable their movement.  You can easily toggle this for all or individual party members if you wish.

Two other features of note are the intelligent targetting routines and improved survivability (backing out of fights if low on health, better use of potions, party members coming to help).  Your party members will feel less dumb and if you like leaving them to their own devices, and they should prove much more formidable.

Also included is a script for summoned units so that they are a little more intelligence than the defaults.  They should stay with the summoner, and they have more intelligent targetting routines.

## Installation

Copy all .bcs files into your /scripts folder for the appropriate game (BGEE or BG2EE).  Within the game change the script to Advanced AI for each character.  All options within the Advanced AI interface are supported as you can think of this script as an upgraded Beamdog script.

You do not need to do anything with the uScript_2001-09-27 file.  I included it in this repository to archive my previous work.
