# uScript: Enhanced Edition

I am the author of the original uScript for the original Baldur's Gate II game (luckily the original has been saved and hosted on sites like Gibberlings3 and Sorcerers.net).  20 years later I've decided to release my newer and rewritten "uScript" that I was using for the Beamdog Enhanced Editions of the games.  Unlike my original uScript, these scripts are based on Beamdog's default player script, and companion AI script.  They work a lot better than my originals and should seemlessly work without issue.

All spells, abilities, and items are supported that Beamdog placed in their scripts.  Since this is a "universal" script, the player and all companions have the same capabilities if they have the spell or ability in question.  This makes your party members capabilies much more consistant.  Personally, I really like the end result of this script.  It's consisistant with the design philosophy that Beamdog set forth.

A feature that I had in my original scripts from 20 years ago was automatic movement.  I persoanlly like my party to stay with me when I'm fighting somewhere on the map.  This movement is MUCH improved from my original scripts and WILL NEVER override your commands.  You can easily toggle this for all or individual party members if you don't like it.

Also included is a script for summoned units so that they are a little more intelligence than the defaults.  They should stay with the summoner, and they have more intelligent attack priotization.

## Installation

Copy all .bcs files into your /scripts folder.  You shouldn't need to switch to these scripts in game unless you are already using a third party script, and in that case it's just like selecting the default script for each character.  The filenames are the same as the original Beamdog scripts so you don't need to select them in game.
